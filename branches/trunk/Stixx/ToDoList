done
use stixView for tagDescriptorController
location icon in tag view - comes from ARCoordinateView
hitting back in tagview results in white pic - wrong view loaded?

dropped stix wrong location (?)
location icon gone if no location
already downloaded pix do not show updated auxStix

Questions for beta testers:
when app closed, is it better to restart it or to keep in background?
camera flash? do you use it more in dark or well lit situations? would flash be annoying?
