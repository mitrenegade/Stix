like/dislike button to replace fire/ice
hide stix mode for viewing original pictures without stix - in zoom view?
fast scroll for feed

bugs:
join as user crashes
clicking on connection message causes keyboard
partially uploaded stix looks bad on feed - add upload complete/success flag
no stix drag outside of stixview
stix manipulation should not allow off image location
// concurrency
check for updated stix in range less than most current
stix manipulation while small stix?

notification bugs
general notifications still pop up on screen when phone is idle
when you jump to a tag from a notification sometimes the tags between it and the most recent are not loaded

outsource projects:
FriendView: add date joined
update friend profiles to reflect true pix counts

major revisions:
better mystix view - categories
location/poi view
add more exploreview options - friend's pix, nearby, etc
real friend lists and privacy - add friend
features only available based on location

tester suggestions:
add text to speech bubble
load pictures from library
combine stix

done
alert view opening closes old alert views - force old ones to close/only have one alert
tap on carousel view = popup picture
fire and ice are instead just a count/upvote/downvote; all stix are aux stix including fire and ice
peel fire stix - do not increment fire count. maybe do not allow fire/ice stix to be peeled
DONE more accurate finger position when peeling
OK FOR NOW - different animation for peelable stix
DONE animate peeling/curling motion of removing stix
DONE Logout: confirmation
DONE feedback button somewhere
DONE add comment button activates when clicked elsewhere
DONE after adding stix jump to feedivew
aux stix location/sizing/comment window -> sizing requires kumulos change (badgeFrame)
stixView should always manipulate one stix and always display all aux stix
when auxstix added, need to check kumulos for updated auxstix for this tag first
didAddStixToPix: add to old tag and reload immediately then replace tag in alltags with new stix from kumulos
peel giftstix to add to collection
use stixview for zoomview
explore doesn't use stixview
use stixView for exploreViewController
*
add aux stix to stixView

location icon in tag view - comes from ARCoordinateView
hitting back in tagview results in white pic - wrong view loaded?
add camera controls/flash/exposure time to tagView
gift stix one time use
0 comments = add comment
dropped stix wrong location (?)
location icon gone if no location
already downloaded pix do not show updated auxStix
