// bugs:
- tagview badgeview not correct order
- if tag is taken before all tags downloaded from server, the size of allTags is wrong? no scroll?
- badges should not be movable until scrollviews appear
- tap on stix view too many times and window crashes

// todo:
- badges saved in dictionary with allTagID as key
- add shake to refresh tagView badges; add shake or drag to refresh feed/friends
- add touch to magnify for feed
- change login screen/password - login in beginning
- add timeout to kumulos 
- add callbacks

**************

fixed
- scrollView gets deleted if we receive memory warning - this happens when we go to addstix view - removed IOKit
- unable to find iokit under /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/4.3.3 etc
Copy IOKit to frameworks/IOKitFramework instead of frameworks/IOKitFramework/Versions/A/
